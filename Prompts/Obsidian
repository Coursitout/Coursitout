   - **Location**: Include geographic coordinates (latitude and longitude) if applicable.

2. **Wikipedia Link**:  
   Embed a collapsible section containing a link to the topic’s Wikipedia page. Use an iframe to allow direct viewing within Obsidian.

3. **Summary** (in **English**):  
   Provide a concise 3-5 sentence overview of the topic.  
   - Explain its historical, cultural, or thematic significance.  
   - Include backlinks to relevant Wikipedia pages in natural, contextual ways (e.g., *"The **[[Maryland Campaign]]** (September 1862) was a pivotal series of battles during the **[[American Civil War]]**, concluding with the **[[Battle of Antietam]]**, the bloodiest single day in American history."*).

4. **Chronology** (in **English**):  
   Create a timeline table listing major events related to the topic. Each entry should include:  
   - **Year**: Use BCE/CE notation.  
   - **Event Name**: Provide a concise title.  
   - **Description**: Explain the event’s significance in 1–2 sentences, incorporating backlinks where relevant (e.g., *“In 1804, **[[Napoleon Bonaparte|Napoleon]]** crowned himself Emperor of the **[[First French Empire]]** at [[Notre-Dame de Paris]].”*).

5. **Trivia** (in **English**):  
   Add an interesting fact or lesser-known detail related to the topic (e.g., a notable anecdote, cultural reference, or surprising statistic).

   Provide a famous quote related to the topic, if applicable. This could be a quote by or about the person, event, or concept being discussed.

7. **Flashcards** (in **French**):  
   Generate 5 **French** flashcards that test the reader’s knowledge of the topic.  
   - Incorporate backlinks formatted as `[[Page Name|Displayed Text]]` when the linked text in French differs from the English Wikipedia page title.  
   - Follow **SuperMemo’s 20 rules of formulating knowledge** to ensure clarity and avoid ambiguity.

   **Flashcard Structure**:  
   - **Title**: Briefly describe the flashcard’s focus (e.g., “Sacre de Napoléon”).

### Additional Considerations:

- **Language and Context**: All sections except the flashcards must be in English, while flashcards must be in French.  
- **Backlinks Integration**: Use backlinks in the **Summary**, **Chronology**, and **Flashcards**. In French flashcards, format backlinks properly when the displayed text differs from the page name. Don't forget to capitalize backlinks. Ensure consistency between all backlinks in the note.
- **Consistency and Accuracy**: Ensure that all historical dates, names, and events match reliable sources and align with Wikipedia page titles.
- **Flashcard Precision**: Follow SuperMemo principles to ensure clarity and focus for effective learning.

This structure ensures the note is well-organized, contextually rich, and optimized for knowledge retention in Obsidian.
